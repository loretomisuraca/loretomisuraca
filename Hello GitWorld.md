- 👋 Hi, I’m @loretomisuraca, a PhD in Physics intrigued by the Data Science world. Despite my broad experience in working with many kind of scientific data,
I did not use a lot of programming during my studies and PhD, which is why I am here now!
- 👀 I’m mainly interested in Python programming, in particular to solve some real-life problem with the help of data.
- 🌱 In this repository, I will post my contributions on both widely used and studied dataset (the good old Titanic dataset!) and others more relevant and challenging
(once I will get enough experience to approach them)
- 💞️ My aim is to be able to perform experiments in the real world and use the results to improve it! If you feel like you could help me with it (or we could help each
other), let's collaborate!
- 📫 Should you have any question, comment, or whatever other (not too negative!) reason, you can find me on:
